# Fake Pi Homework 1

## Write-up
This homework assignment was relatively straight forward. I am using Debian on 
both my laptop and home desktop and the instructions that were provided on the
canvas homework 1 assignment page worked without issue. So that's really all I 
did though, more or less copy and pasted the instructions with my fingers 
crossed hoping that they would work and sure enough they did. As I didn't run into any
system complaints in the process, I would say it went very well. Some things I 
found interesting are the apparent ease of setup for embedded development on 
linux boxes. In industry, is it commond for linux to be used as a development 
environment? I really enjoy using linux on my personal computers but I have seen
some embedded engineers using windows due to the tooling that their companies
require. Another thing that I am curious about is the cross-compilation steps
for a C program. I feel like Rust makes it very easy to handle cross compliation 
where as in C I have had to use a somewhat complicated makefile. I know it's 
out of scope for this class but I would like to chat about some of the ways to 
do our projects in C if the time is available. I am really aiming to work in 
the embedded space in the near future and would be much appreciative of any 
advice or feedback at any point throughout the course. Thanks for making this class
happen. I am looking forward to learning from y'all.
