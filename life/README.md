# Game of Life on the Microbit V2 

- Here is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life on the microbit V2 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life. The microbit v2 has a 5x5 LED array that is used to depict the different life forms that occur in the game of life. There are two buttons on the Microbit, A and B. The A button is used to Randomize the LED's and B button is used to complement (Negate) the current LED's. The game will run until there is no life left or it reaches a sustainable life form. Things left that I want to do is fix the random number generator and add a screen that shows when no life is left.
